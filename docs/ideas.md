# Ideas  
  
I've been checking out [textual](https://textual.textualize.io), to potentially use it for the tui of the application. It seems impressive, I will check it out.  
While doing so, I've also stumbled upon the [llm python package](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) which seems to provide useful functionality for what I'm planning.  
I will explore using these packages.
